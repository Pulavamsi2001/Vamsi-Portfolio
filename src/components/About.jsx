      I am a recent graduate with a strong foundation in web development and hands-on training from Beaseant Technologies. 
      I am skilled in building dynamic user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS. On the back-end, 
      I work with Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io to create robust applications. My database expertise includes 
      PL/SQL, Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. With experience in development tools like Visual Studio Code 
      and Git, and familiarity with deployment on Vercel and Firebase, I am enthusiastic about applying my skills to 
      real-world projects. Explore my portfolio to see my work and connect with me for potential opportunities.
